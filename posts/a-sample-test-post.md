The shooting came the same night President Joe Biden [addressed the nation](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/politics/joe-biden-guns-speech/index.html) on the need for stricter gun laws. Gun massacres have left the country shaken and prompted new discussions about how to prevent them. The most recent incident was just a day earlier, when a man bought an AR-15 style rifle and attacked an [Oklahoma hospital](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/03/us/tulsa-hospital-shooting-friday/index.html), killing four people and then himself.

In Iowa, authorities got a call of shots fired in the parking lot at 6:51 p.m., they said.

The shooter arrived in a pickup truck “and the chaos began,” Fitzgerald said.

“He went right into action when he got there,” he said. “He was there for a specific purpose, which he accomplished.”
